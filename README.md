# Brief Overview

Health Profiles is a programme to improve availability and accessibility for health and health related information in England. The profiles give a snapshot overview of health for each local authority in England. Health Profiles are produced annually. <br>
Designed to help local government and health services make decisions and plans to improve local people's health and reduce health inequalities, the profiles present a set of health indicators that show how the area compares to the national average. <br> The indicators are carefully selected each
year to reflect important public health topics. <br> <br>

## Objective
The task is to inform the health authorities on the relations between health indicators and socioeconomic and demographic indicators and if possible, time permitted, create a predictive model. <br>

You will need to describe an analysis strategy, process and merge the data from a database, investigate the relations, model a particular relation and describe how you would inform the authorities on possible future outcomes.
